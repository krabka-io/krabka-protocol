# Releasing

A release of this repository is an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`. The push
of the tag starts [`publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/publish.yml), which
publishes the library crates to crates.io. No other workflow publishes them.

The workspace releases as one unit. Every published crate inherits
`[workspace.package] version`, so one tag names one version of all of them.

## The published crates

| Crate | Depends on |
| :--- | :--- |
| `krabka-units` | |
| `krabka-ids` | |
| `krabka-voters` | `krabka-ids` |
| `krabka-hlc` | `krabka-ids`, `krabka-units` |
| `krabka-trace-context` | |
| `krabka-compression` | `krabka-units` |
| `krabka-security` | `krabka-units` |
| `krabka-protocol` | `krabka-compression`, `krabka-units` |
| `krabka-metadata` | `krabka-ids`, `krabka-protocol`, `krabka-security`, `krabka-units`, `krabka-voters` |

`krabka-protocol-codegen` and `krabka-kafka-tap` set `publish = false`. They
are tools of this repository, not libraries. A new member crate is published
unless its manifest sets `publish = false`.

Each published crate takes `repository`, `license`, `authors`, `edition` and
`rust-version` from the workspace. Its `include` list ships the library source
and its README, but not its tests, benches or fixtures. Cargo prints an
"ignoring test" warning for each `[[test]]` and `[[bench]]` that the package
leaves out. The warnings are expected.

The other krabka repositories publish their crates from their own workflows.
Their crates depend on these, so crates.io must have a release of this
repository first. The order is:

1. krabka-protocol
2. krabka-client-rs
3. krabka-schema-registry
4. krabka-broker

## 1. Prepare the version

Set the new version in these places:

- `[workspace.package] version` in the root `Cargo.toml`.
- The first-party `version` requirements in `[workspace.dependencies]`, and
  the same requirements in each member `Cargo.toml`. A path dependency also
  carries a version, and `cargo publish` uses that version in the published
  manifest.
- `version` in `MODULE.bazel`.
- Each `#![doc(html_root_url = "https://docs.rs/krabka-<name>/<version>")]`.

Then run `cargo update --workspace` to update `Cargo.lock`. Move the
`Unreleased` entries of each crate's `CHANGELOG.md` under the new version.

Before you merge, run a dry run from the branch: start `publish.yml` from the
Actions tab with `dry_run` on. It packages each crate and builds it from the
packaged sources, as crates.io users get them.

## 2. Tag the release

Tag the merge commit on `main`, then push the tag:

```sh
git tag -a v0.5.1 -m "krabka-protocol 0.5.1"
git push origin v0.5.1
```

## 3. What the workflow does

The `plan` job holds no credential. It:

1. stops unless the tagged commit is an ancestor of `origin/main`.
2. stops unless a `push` run of `ci.yml` passed on that commit.
3. stops unless every published crate has the version that the tag names.
4. asks the crates.io API which crate versions exist, and keeps the others.
5. runs `cargo publish --dry-run` over the crates that it kept. Cargo resolves
   a pending sibling from the packages it has just made, and every other
   dependency from crates.io.

The `publish` job runs in the `crates-io` environment. It uploads the pending
crates one at a time, in dependency order. Cargo waits until each crate is in
the index before it uploads the next one.

A rerun is safe. The `plan` job skips each version that crates.io already
has, so a rerun after a failure uploads only the rest.

A manual run takes two inputs:

- `dry_run`, on by default. Off, the run uploads, and it must start from a
  `v*` tag.
- `crates`, a space-separated list of crate names. A run with a list publishes
  only those crates. Use it when one crate cannot publish and the others must
  not wait for it.

## Credentials: bootstrap, then trusted publishing

The `publish` job authenticates with one of two credentials:

- **A token.** When the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret of the `crates-io`
  environment is set, the job uses it.
- **Trusted publishing.** When that secret is not set, the job runs
  [`rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action`](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action).
  The action exchanges the job's GitHub OIDC token for a crates.io token. That
  token expires after 30 minutes, and the action revokes it when the job ends.
  No long-lived secret exists.

crates.io allows trusted publishing only for a crate that already exists. So
the first release of each crate name needs the token, and every later release
uses trusted publishing.

### Once: the GitHub environment

In the repository settings, open **Environments** and create `crates-io`. Under
**Deployment branches and tags**, allow only tags that match `v*`. Add required
reviewers if a person should approve each publish.

### First publish of a crate name

1. Sign in to crates.io with the account that will own the crates. Under
   **Account Settings**, open **API Tokens** and create a token with the
   `publish-new` and `publish-update` scopes. Limit it to the crate pattern
   `krabka-*` and give it a short expiry.
2. Add the token to the `crates-io` environment as the secret
   `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`.
3. Push the release tag, or rerun `publish.yml` on it.

crates.io limits new crate names to a burst of five, then one every ten
minutes. The first publish of the nine crates therefore takes about 40
minutes. On a `429` answer the job waits ten minutes and tries again.

### Then: trusted publishing for each crate

For each published crate:

1. On crates.io, open the crate, then **Settings**, then **Trusted
   Publishing**.
2. Add a GitHub publisher with these values:
   - Repository owner: `krabka-io`
   - Repository name: `krabka-protocol`
   - Workflow filename: `publish.yml`
   - Environment: `crates-io`

When all nine crates have a publisher, delete the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
secret, and revoke the token on crates.io. The next release uses trusted
publishing. Its log says "publishing through trusted publishing".

A crate that joins the published set later needs the token once, for its
first release. Add the secret again for that release, configure the new
crate's publisher, and delete the secret again.

## The sspi dependency

`krabka-security` depends on
[`krabka-sspi`](https://crates.io/crates/krabka-sspi), renamed to `sspi` in
the workspace manifest. `krabka-sspi` is a temporary crates.io release of
[krabka-io/sspi-rs](https://github.com/krabka-io/sspi-rs): upstream `sspi`
0.23.0 plus the MIT Kerberos interoperability fixes
([devolutions/sspi-rs#738](https://github.com/Devolutions/sspi-rs/pull/738))
and the #764 fix. Its library is still named `sspi`, so the code says
`use sspi::...`.

When an upstream `sspi` release contains those fixes, change the workspace
entry to that `sspi` version and drop `package = "krabka-sspi"`. Then release.
krabka-io/sspi-rs's `docs/krabka-sspi-release.md` covers deprecating and
yanking `krabka-sspi` after that.

## Retire the crabka crates

Krabka was called Crabka. The robot-head account published 45 `crabka-*`
crates from `robot-head/crabka`. They are retired once, by
[`retire-crabka.yml`](../.github/workflows/retire-crabka.yml). For each crate,
the workflow:

1. publishes a tombstone release, the next patch after the highest version.
   The tombstone has no code. Its description, README and crate docs name the
   new crate, or the repository of the successor.
2. yanks every other version.

The table in the workflow maps each `crabka-*` crate to its successor. The
first step compares the table with the crates that robot-head owns on
crates.io, and stops when they differ.

Run the retirement only after the first publish of every `krabka-*` crate that
the table names, in all four repositories. A tombstone links to its `krabka-*`
crate, and that link must work.

1. Sign in to crates.io as robot-head. Create a token with the
   `publish-update` and `yank` scopes, limited to the crate pattern `crabka-*`.
2. In this repository, create the environment `crabka-retirement` and add the
   token to it as the secret `CRABKA_CRATES_IO_TOKEN`.
3. Start `retire-crabka.yml` with `dry_run` on. Read the log. It shows each
   tombstone version and each version it would yank.
4. Start it again with `dry_run` off.
5. Delete the secret and the environment, and revoke the token.

The run is idempotent. It finds an existing tombstone by its description,
which starts with "Renamed:", and it does not yank a version twice. crates.io
rate-limits new versions and yanks, so the run sleeps between uploads and
waits on a `429` answer. About 290 versions get yanked, so the run takes
hours. If it reaches the six-hour job limit, start it again.

The `yank` input is on by default. Turn it off to publish only the
tombstones.
